<span style="font-size:12pt;"> **Better or Worse? Biased Decisions from Human-Machine Collaboration**</span><br>

    <p style="font-size:11pt;"> Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) introduced the replay review system to improve the accuracy and fairness of the umpire decisions in 2014. However, we show that the winning probability of the home team has significantly increased after the implementation, which implies that the introduction of the replay review system deteriorated the fairness of the umpireâ€™s decisions. Our interpretation is that it is because of the imperfect system design. Because the replay review chances are limited to two times, the umpires ended up having incentives to give favorable decisions for the home team.

<span style="font-size:12pt;"> <strong>Are Young Criminals Rational?</strong></span><br>
<span style="font-size:11pt;">   <a href="#/" onclick="visib('abs_are')">Abstract</a> |  [Paper](https://ByunghunHahn.github.io/research/Are_Young_Criminals_Rational.pdf)</span> 

<div id="abs_are" style="display: none;"> 
    <p style="font-size:11pt;">  We develop a model in which individuals accumulate two types of human capital: legal and crime-specific, both of which grow through learning by doing. Juveniles in their final year before losing juvenile status anticipate higher future costs of crime, giving them an incentive to shift effort toward legal work. The model therefore predicts that individuals on the verge of this transition are more likely to desist from crime even before reaching the age of majority. Using FBI arrestee data, we empirically validate this prediction. Exploiting policy changes in four states that raised the age of criminal majority from 17 to 18, we find causal evidence that juveniles in their final year while legally treated as juveniles commit fewer crimes than comparable age groups.

**Works in Progress**

<span style="font-size:12pt;"> **Evaluating the performance of different high school types: Based on the change of Korean University Entrance System**</span><br>
<span style="font-size:11pt;"> (Written in Korean, Awarded Undergraduate Independent Study 2024 at SNU) </span><br>
<span style="font-size:11pt;">   <a href="#/" onclick="visib('abs_evaluating')">Abstract</a> |  [Paper (draft coming soon)]</span> 

<div id="abs_evaluating" style="display: none;">
    <p style="font-size:11pt;"> In Korea, there are two types of university entrance systems: Jeongsi, based on a single Korean SAT score, and Susi, based on three years of high school grades. Starting from 2022, Korea increased the proportion of Jeongsi from 23% to 40%. We examine the impact of this policy by analyzing Seoul National University acceptance rates from 2018 to 2023 across different types of high schools. The results show that high schools in wealthy areas, the three Gangnam districts, saw a significant increase in acceptance rates. In contrast, specialized high schools did not experience a notable increase, and non-metropolitan high schools saw a decline.

<span style="font-size:12pt;"> **Calculating the Difficulty of Platform Change**</span><br>
<span style="font-size:11pt;">   <a href="#/" onclick="visib('abs_calculating')">Abstract</a> |  [Paper (draft coming soon)]</span> 

<div id="abs_calculating" style="display: none;">
    <p style="font-size:11pt;"> We consider various network structures and show that the acceptability of a new platform greatly depends on the structure of the existing network. Theoretic Analysis indicates that in the past where people were mostly engaged in a small local interaction, it can be easier to accept a new superior platform. Also, We show that unequal power distribution inside a network and the existence of an influencer would make the acceptance of a new superior platform easier.
